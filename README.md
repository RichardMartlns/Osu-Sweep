# osu! Sweep

> A safe, smart, and user-friendly desktop utility to manage and clean large osu! beatmap collections based on game modes.

osu! Sweep is a desktop utility for Windows, built in C# and WPF, designed for osu! rhythm game players. 
The goal is to provide a tool to free up disk space and organize the player's library by identifying and deleting beatmaps from game modes they don't play.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Hybrid Map Identification**: Uses the osu! API as the primary method and a deep file scan as a fallback.
-   **Smart Deletion Logic**: Deletes entire folders or just specific `.osu` files, preserving the modes you want to keep.
-   **User Safety First**: Features a clear confirmation screen and defaults to moving files to the Recycle Bin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend (Desktop App)**: C# with WPF (.NET 8) using the MVVM pattern.
-   **Backend (Serverless API)**: C# on Azure Functions to protect the API key and cache requests.
